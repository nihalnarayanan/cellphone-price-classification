# Cell Phone Price Classification

This machine learning project predicts the price range category of mobile phones based on hardware features such as RAM, battery power, camera quality, and more.

### 🎯 Objective
Classify mobile phones into 4 price categories using supervised learning techniques.

### 📊 Dataset
Public dataset containing 2000 mobile phones with 21 features such as:
• Battery Power  
• RAM  
• Processor Speed  
• Internal Memory  
• Primary and Front Camera  
• Talk Time  
• Display Resolution, etc.

### 🧠 Methodology
• Data Preprocessing and Standardization  
• EDA for feature importance and correlations  
• Applied Classification Algorithms:
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Logistic Regression  
• Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  

### ✅ Model Performance
Best Model: **Random Forest Classifier**  
Accuracy Achieved: **89%**  
Precision, Recall, and F1-score reported for performance evaluation.

### 📈 Key Insights
• RAM and Battery Power are the top predictors of price range  
• Phones with high-resolution displays tend to fall in premium segments
